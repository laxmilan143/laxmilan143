## Examples Of my work
  ### Test Cases
As a Software QA Engineer, I have developed and executed comprehensive test cases to ensure software quality and performance. My test cases encompass a variety of testing methodologies, including functional testing, regression testing, integration testing, performance/load testing, and user acceptance testing. Each test case is meticulously crafted to cover different scenarios and edge cases, ensuring thorough validation of application functionalities.

I utilize tools such as Jira to document and track bugs, ensuring clear communication and efficient resolution of issues. My test cases are detailed with clear steps, expected results, and actual outcomes, providing a structured approach to identifying and resolving defects. This systematic testing ensures that the software meets technical and business requirements, delivering a reliable and user-friendly experience.
